            <h2>Great Captain of Pakistan</h2>
            <p>As a bowler, Khan initially bowled with a relatively chest-on action, at medium-pacehowever, he worked hard to remodel his action to a more classical type, and to strengthen his body, to enable fast bowling.[81][82] Khan attained his prime as a fast bowler in January 1980 till 1988 when he became out and out fast bowler. During this span Imran picked 236 test wickets at 17.77 apiece with 18 five-wicket hauls and 5 10 wicket hauls. His bowling average and strike rate were better than Richard Hadlee (19.03), Malcolm Marshall (20.20) Dennis Lillee, Joel Garner, and Michael Holding. In January 1983, playing against India, he attained a Test bowling rating of 922 points.At the height of his career, in 1982,[89] the thirty-year-old Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad.[90] As a captain, Khan played 48 Test matches, of which 14 were won by Pakistan, 8 lost and the remaining 26 were drawn. He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie.[75]

                In the team's second match, Khan led them to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord's.[91] Khan's first year as captain was the peak of his legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder. He recorded the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981â€“1982.[75] He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three-Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat.</p>
